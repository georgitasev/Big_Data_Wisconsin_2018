This is the repo for Georgi Tasev's Big Data Wisconsin 2018 Tutorial Session, entitled "Liberate Your Inner Data Scientist Through a Simple Exercise."  

You may find links to Georgi's bio and abstract here:  [bio](https://2018.bigdatawisconsin.org/speakers/georgi-tasev/) and [abstract](https://2018.bigdatawisconsin.org/sessions/tutorial-liberate-your-inner-data-scientist-through-a-simple-exercise/)

## Preparing for the Tutorial
We will be highlighting key facets of data science through the exploration of [Kaggle's Titanic Survivor Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic); to do this, we will be utilizing the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) during this session, primarily focusing on [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter-Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).  

### Install Anaconda
In preparation for the tutorial, please download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python here:  [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  The download link will auto-detect your operating system and will provide you with the appropriate link for download onto Windows, Linux, and MacOS; you should install Python 2.7 for the purposes of this tutorial.

### Review the Titanic problem on Kaggle
In preparation for the tutorial, please read the [overview](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), [explanation of the datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), and check out a few of the [starter kits](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/kernels) provided by the Kaggle community.  Consider this an exercise akin to reading the "Lab Manual" prior to a bio or chemsitry lab.  It shall give you an adequate understanding of what we are trying to accomplish during the tutorial.
